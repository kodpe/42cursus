 > The C Piscine C06 is extremely important to validate the exams and easy to learn, do it before C05 !

 > The last exercise of each day is often particularly hard, you should skip them and maybe come back to them later.
 > However for the whole month the most important exercise to know is ft_split of C Piscine C07.                     
 > Good mastery of the exercises up to C Piscine C07 gives you a very good mark in the final exam :)

 > The minimal step advised is only my opinion based on my personal experience
